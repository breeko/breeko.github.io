      <description>A recent blog post caught my attention. The author wanted to see how long it would take for him to get an identical distribution of Skittles in a bag. He estimated a reasonable estimate of 400–500 bags would be required for him to open before he found a matching bag. After [spoiler alert] 468 bags, he finally found a matching bag.
I wanted to test this his results empirically while also being lazy.</description>
