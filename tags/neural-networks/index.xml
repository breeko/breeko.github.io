      <description>In a prior post, Offline Object Detection and Tracking on a Raspberry Pi, I wrote an implementation of an offline object detection model. Since that time, aws has begun to offer some great services in that space, so I felt it was time to write about building an online object detection model with aws.
Use-Case My use-case is the same as the original article: take a picture periodically, process it, and display some information as to the location of given objects over time.</description>
