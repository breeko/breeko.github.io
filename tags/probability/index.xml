      <description>Optimal Bet Size Using Kelly Criterion TLDR: When placing a wager, choosing a bet size is as important as an edge. Kelly Criterion is a simple formula that determines the bet size for the highest growth in repeated games. I made a calculator/simulator to play out alternative strategies.
Suppose I offered you to play a game where we flip coins using a fair coin. If it lands on tails, you lose $1, but if it lands on heads, you win $1.</description>

      <description>A recent blog post caught my attention. The author wanted to see how long it would take for him to get an identical distribution of Skittles in a bag. He estimated a reasonable estimate of 400–500 bags would be required for him to open before he found a matching bag. After [spoiler alert] 468 bags, he finally found a matching bag.
I wanted to test this his results empirically while also being lazy.</description>
