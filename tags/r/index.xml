      <description>ESPN fantasy football projection are free and available historically. Although they differ from DraftKing, they are granular enough to be converted and compared. Let’s see their predictive power
In this post we’ll use ESPN predictions to optimize our fantasy pool. You can skip to the bottom for the code or just visit my github. For more information on R programming for data science, I recommend the book Practical Statistics for Data Scientists</description>
