      <description>Load and run YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model on a Raspberry Pi and track objects throughout the day.
In my last post I wrote about the YOLO model used for object detection. The most surprising thing was how simple the model is. Itâ€™s so simple that it can run offline on a raspberry pi

      <description>YOLO provides state of the art real-time object detection and classification.
The YOLO image detection model is one of the fastest and most accurate object detection models. Flexible and fast, YOLO is a huge step forward in machine learning.
I came across a popular post on hackernews titled How to easily Detect Objects with Deep Learning on Raspberry Pi. The article discusses the YOLO object detection model that can be used for real-time object detection and classification.</description>
